Purpose: I"d like to express gratitude towards everything I owe my existence to.

Often, I think of the origins of things. WHere they came from, Why they exist, how they came about to exist ? and the things that went into their being.

I realize, I'm one of those many things that's presented with the power to make a wide array of actions, to impact the world and so much more.
I am resident to power. I ask myself what if changed would I have not been here.
Quite frankly, there's a ton. 
I talk to people from vairous walks of life and more often than not, they make me think. 
I love the work that goes on within the venture capital industry for they empower people to bring to reality, their idealistic version/vision of the world by means of business.

I love the software world for there is so much to build. Its like legos. There is so much that can be built.

I love the design sphere for it sparks joy in daily usage. I realize that user expereince can be much worse as I progress through designing interfaces that I'm personally repulsed by. I know as a customer I'd never probably use something like this willfully except for the utility it provides and user experience being about how people feel, that forms a greater factor as to if people will actually use a product or a service.

Me, being able to have such conversations about such a wide array of topics, I think would not have been possible if a lot of things did not happen when they happened.

For example, being born in a place, to parents, to siblings, to culture, to grow up in a city, to have the privilege to meet and interact with people that foster thinking and amongst other activities, to spur people of the world to make it a better place.
To have the luxury to access the wide forray of knowledge available on the internet. To have the flexibility, time and resources to choose, and carve my path towards one where I can earn by sitting, thinking and moving my  fingers from when I had to physically lift trash cans, sweep and clean toilets. Its quite a lot to fathom, but no amount of words can do justice to express how thankful I am to be presented with opportunities as such. 

I come across people that I admire for various reasons. I adore they way they think about things that impact them and they world. The way they take care as to what they believe forms them as people.

Today, If I weren't born to parents I am born to, or if I did not happen to meet people I happen to meet off chance that have brought insight or perspectives that only came to be of relevance over a decade later, if I didn't find sense in strip comics that still describe how I look at life later, I'd like to think I'd be an entirely different person. 

I don't know what I don't know. Off late, what I thought I knew and I didn't have resulted in situations that aren't exactly pleasant.

Things that happen beyond my control, also shape who I am. Things that happen within my control, shape who I am. Things, people I interact with daily make me who I am. People that I happend to chance upon, make me who I am. The world around me, makes me who I am.


I'm thankful to every single person, I've had the good fortune of knowing, interacting with and had the luxury to use of products made, insights that impacted high value decisions later, I'm indebted to you.

Dear world, I'm a resultant of what you make me. Sure I have some say in what I do and interact with in daily life and as I continue in this quest for freedom for choice of liviing, activity, work and impact. I shall incur more debts that I can be greatful for than I can ever personally thank in person.

Everyone that tills soil somewhere to building software that I get joy in using, I thank you for making my life better. You are the true underlying people that deserve credit.

I understand that personal gratitude cannot scale. I cannot track back every single person that's had an impact on my life.
I write this letter to serve as token of gratitude. Thank you.

Also, there are at times, I come across some incredible people (both on internet and in person); Their ideals, their morals, their goals, their vision, their familial priniciples, their approach to life, their perspectives, the impact of the interactions rubs off on me for which I might have made decisions that later are consequential to rising in the socail hierarchy. 

In the fututre, Never do I think to insist that it was because of mine and only mine, efforts brought about outcomes that result in my present day or future self. I try, truly to put my heart, mind and sinew towards directions led by decion making ability incrued over years of research and work by others. 

I solemnly swear to try and make effort to the best of my abilities to bring about a better world to exist in for my future generations.

I've wanted this for so long, that it no longer is fueled by rational thought but by emotion too.

Like the stories that in rational tone make sense but inspire none, songs that are short and express emotions but cause irrational actions, I bring this letter to you, to thank you, to persuade you towards making this world a better place, to make this world a closer reality for people's dreams, aspirations and youth, for it is our moral responsibility to pay it forward.

This sort of does stem of a selfish place. 

I want my children to live in a better world than I got to experience life in.

I want them to make it better for their children and so forth.

I want them to live a better life, solve problems that helps other people, be among people that think in similar lines, yet diverse in thought and expression. The world I dream my children to live in, is the world that my parents dreamt for me and my fellow cousins in this evolutionary journey.

For lack of this sounding communistic or something with labeled, I urge you, to express, to consicously think and act, towards making this a better place for my children, your children and all our future generations alike.

THank you.
