# What do you bring to the table?

I believe everybody has a responsibility towards our world.

I believe everyone has something to bring to the table in their pursuit to change or help improve the existing system.
It could be skiils, expertise, experience, relationships, connections, ability to sell, talent, ideas, grind/hustle or money.

Each person has a role to play in our society.
Each person is equipped with enough resources to execute that role efficiently.

**Example**:
    Adam wants to open a tech company. He might not have the money but has necessary tech exprience and the industry experience.
    He can leverage his technical expertise to get to where he wants.
    There are multitude of options such as freelancing and venture fund raising which he could use judiciously to execute his mission.
    Similarly, a person that starts at the rock bottom, with no skills, expertise or finances but wants to make a difference has abundant time.
    He can leverage time to gain skills that he could leverage again to get the necessary finance.

### The point is that there are options.
Acknowledging and utilizing those options is a personal choice.

> Caveat: Factors are multipliers.

There is no single factor that shall ensure success or merit in the field that you decide to venture in.
It is, eventually a combination of all the factors that go into the resulting outcome.

Thank you
