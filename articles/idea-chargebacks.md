Blockchain systems are meant to be a permanent record of information.

Transactions made on blockchains currently cannot be changed unless forked or a 51% attack takes place.

The proposed model allows for "chargebacks" within a certain period of time to prevent burnt addresses and possibly escrow services.

Lightning protocol allows for hedging a cryptoasset and transact with a volume lesser cumulatively lesser than that of the hedged amount

Our chargeback model proposes a time frame within which if the intended recipient doesn't spend his cryptoasst, a write function sends the cryptoasset back to the sender address.

This prevents people from unknowingly burning tokens and helps resolve disputes.

Using lightning's method of shared secrets, we can ascertain if someone has been cheated.
In an event of cheating, the blockchain must be able to make the necessary changes to account for the change and hence direct the cryptoasset judiciously.

This will be the initial step for building a legally binding payment structure from a declaration.
