# What is my role on Earth ?

I believe that I was put on this Earth to make a positive difference. 
I take great interest in ways education, Emotional Intelligence and economy are wielded by many.
I’ve always wanted to run a school which imparts morals, values and ethics of different trades.
I would like to start a company specialising in finance and Startup incubators to better understand where the world is heading towards. As Abraham Lincoln rightly said, “One cannot help the poor by being one of them.”
I would learn the system before trying to cause a change within it.
My mission on Earth is to leave it a better place than when I got it and I shall strive to make it happen.
I hold great respect for Family, Relationships, loyalty and commitment for they form a major portion of my life. I take immense pride in how far I’ve come and I believe there is a long way to go before I have fulfilled my mission.
There were challenges which brought about a fear of devastation at many stages of my life,but hadn’t it been for those I wouldn’t have the courage to do many things that I do today on a regular basis nor would I have curiosity to seek more.
I sincerely do believe that my mission on earth is to make a positive impact and leave it a better place than I found it to be.
