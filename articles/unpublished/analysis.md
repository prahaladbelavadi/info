In Iyengar ted talk, she talks abot how authoritarian behaviour differs in different cultures.

- **Base: 1**

In western countries, people are expected and trust themselves in making better choices where as in asian countries, people rely and are influenced by their parents or on information from an authoritarian source.

People in asian countries essentially expect to be told what to do and directed appropriately.
This is innately related to their culture and upbringing.

People within western countries make their own choices and believe that having made their choice, have secured their own outcome.
This also is innately related to their culture and surrounding behaviour.

_In western countries, people tend to think that their choices have a higher and a better predicted outcome than  what would've otherwise been the case_
