My vision for incoming fundraising landscape 
This article talks about my views, expectations of how the fundraising landscape can and is evolving rapidly to someday replace our current systems.
Fundraising has never been easier.
People can now whip up an idea, place it at a platform for being judged and assemble a team to accomplish it before raising funding.
The internet today is a giant stage where ideas walk past millions of people everyday. People judge, evaluate and invest in their free will.
Gone are the days where one with an idea had to raise seed, angel, series 1, series 2, series 3 and/or possibly IPO somewhere in the middle.
At large, We shall compare ICOs to IPOs.
Governments require investors to have a certain amount of personal wealth and investments and then some to be able to invest in companies independently.
IMO, the governments did this to protect money from losing value by getting into the wrong hands and allow experienced people to ideally guide people that were about to build something from the funding that they would eventually receive. Governments essentially wanted to restrict the amount of dumb money that flows into this sector. By establishing guidelines and rules, their intent was primarily to associate the smart people and people that could use their guidance and build something for the successive generations.
ICOs allow the public to give anyone with an idea funds.
As much as ICOs allow the common man to invest in the future of the world, the common man doesn’t know bat shit about the investing landscape as much as a seasoned veteran in the VC industry.
Adam Smith talks about specialization of fields allow the system to prosper, but by having everyone become a trader, investor or a marketer; We fall back to the days when every man had to bake, brew and butcher themselves.

A sure fire precursor of the market about to lose shape is when everyone tries to do everything or in a scenario where unwarranted, unskilled labour is being expended at exporbitant rates that the public themselves can’t afford to back.
This is beyond just inflation or deflation.
In our economic world, different games are designed daily.
There’s always a correction when things do not function as they were intended to.

I know people that worked for companies whose shares were being sold from door to door by the founder.
