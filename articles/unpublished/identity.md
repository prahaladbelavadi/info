Identity
This article talks about identity.


---

Who are you ?
How do you answer the question “Who are you ?” 
You’d probably describe your profession, job, work title or what you do (or have done) for a living; Probably even include or begin with your name.
Today, there’s no shame in admitting that we are defined by what we do. 
Our identity is expressed as a function of a specialized task that we perform.
Explicitly, our identity is a function of a how or what we spend our time doing.
Identity is an anchor to numerous things that flail around in this tiny little world of massive complexity.
Identity of a person is not just linked to what they do or are currently doing but is an embodiment of what they’ve previously done as well.
Our identity, today consists of what we do, what we’ve done and then some.
Long gone are the days where we introduced ourselves with just our names.
“Hello, I’m Prahalad Belavadi”, wouldn’t mean squat to someone at New York times square. 
They’d probably ask “So what ?” or “Why do I care ?” and I hold no grudge for them rightly asking so. I’d probably do the same.
Our identity is inherently changing everyday. Every single day we expend time to perform actions and constantly challenge our existing model of thinking. 
The question “Who are you ?” sometimes even is threatening.
The question indicates an enquiry towards your identity.
Our name isn’t associated with our identity.
We believe it to be so. We’ve been taught so and hence have ascertained such that we shall call ourself and shall respond to our names when called.
This immediate response is largely a conditioned reflex.
You don’t know your name is associated with your identity unless you believe it to, until then its all gibberish, language is gibberish.






action is tied to identity
Opinions that you refuse to change or are stubborn about form a part of your identity.


One can define their identity and work towards it.
Identity is composed of what one does, is good at, has acquired and their opinions or their perspectives on things.
Fluid opinions result in fluid identity
People that can change their opinion or perspective have a fluid ever changing identity.
People can choose to not define their identity based on certain factors.
Consensus of other people in the society also to a significant amount define identity of people in the society.
Moving out of the society does not change a person identity or the impact of their subsequent actions.
Events often leave a scar. A scar, taint or a mark on one’s life. The mark can be favourable to a particular event or aversive to the outcomes of a outcome of an event. People can choose how to approach certain challenges or events based on their previous history. People are at times disadvantaged due to their  experience in different industries. Ability to change perspectives and opinions allows for a fluid identity which eventually translates into survival of the fittest. 
People that can adapt their identity as necessary would survive longer.
Identity is no longer a single faced or a two faced scenario.
Identity is a multi faced warfield. People that agree or disagree with certain features of intra class identity form groups. People that can agree, disagree and improvise upon their identities enact as courtiers and often in a warfield they aren’t present. Courtiers or people with the ability to fluidly change their identity have a greatest chance of survival.
Identity by form of proof of work done is harder to sway.
Identity by proof of work operates under different rules.
Identity by proof of work can span over to a certain sectors.
Given that our time on earth is limited by time, prioritising our choice to gain mastery over certain subjects to produce outputs is favourable. However, as one gains mastery over each subject, there exists cognizant cognitive bias that tends to favour a subject or perspectives from lens of a subject in which you hold mastery in.
For example, a cook would view fish differently than a fisherman would.
A cook is great at cooking and fisherman is great at fishing and yet objectively view fish in different manner. They see different value and desire a different outcome from the fish irrespective of their current association.
Given a choice for anything that might or might not be relatively similar to cooking or fishing, one would inadvertently view the situation from their own lens. Everyone develops their own lens of objectively viewing events and situations throughout their own lives based on their experiences and so forth.
Lenses from which people view situations adds to their identity.
My identity is a cumulative dependant factor based on what I’ve seen, my experience towards certain events and the training I’ve received as is the case for anyone else.
People view things differently and choose to associate emotions with certain events or situations. Again, being able to view such emotions and interactions amongst different people allow you to fluidly change your identity to be receptive and accordingly act. 
Identity as a fluid component has certain factors that are objectively desirable by the vast majority of the society to which they belong.
Collectivism is one such expected trait as is Hard working and honest nature.
Grouping or groupism allows you to associate your identity with a bunch of other people’s identity to collectively be represented as one entity.
Groupism works under different dynamics.
The following quote is one example as such.
“In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.”
— Friedrich Nietzsche
Channeling Individuality and collective interests in groups is an art that has been refined over and over since the existence of mankind.
Humans decided to work together for a collective good; for a better chance at achieving their goals that they wouldn’t be able to do so alone.
As Yuval Noah Harari describes in his talks and learnings of human societal behaviour, he describes how humans are different from animals for their ability to imagine which results in them collaborating over fictional elements of projected future possible events.
Identity of a person in groups operate under a different set of frameworks.
The dynamics on basis of which the collective entity is judged vary by intensity and criteria of which would otherwise be considered of for an independent man with no association to a collective entity whatsoever.
The question of trust is observed to be variable within groups and at an individual level. Michelin star ratings and a hipster or an satanist  group and a lawyer speaks to our different biases that are associated to our identity derived from our time as a part of our collective society.
