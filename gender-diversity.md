There has been a generational history of oppression amidst races, genders, orientation and so much more.
This is evident. There is no denying it.

I agree that people coming from under-represented backgrounds require equal opportunity and availability of resources to be able to learn, educate themselves and live as equals. 
I find it ostentatious that people are touting gender ratios. 
I find, it is indicative of nothing rather than the pure set of people that managed to make it past the bar.

It is quite silly to change hiring dynamics to ascertain to a particular ratio.
Statistics are what we obtain after the event.
Trying to model or make changes in strategies to make numbers look pretty is flawed, I feel.

Give the job to someone that has worked hard for it; to someone that is deserving of it.

By creating a barrier to let colored people apply in the name of diversity, isn't it just more division ?

Why is it that when people complain about oppression and demand equality, they don't push for equality, they don't compete under similar factors ? They push towards privilege.

They want additional leverage for what happened to them 10 score years ago.

Women, agreed that there exist statistics that show that they are relatively more productive than men.
Basing your entire strategy on hiring only women isn't wise that way, hire the best instead.

Let them compete on equal grounds.

I don't think my stance would be any different if I was born a woman. 
My question would be to ask, why are they hiring me based on my gender and not my skills ?

Gender, race and background aren't things we should be discriminating on to balance scales since it does more harm than good.
Provide opportunity to everyone. Let everyone try. Let everyone compete on an equal scale.

Touting gender ratios is a red flag. It is indicative of similar thinking towards saying, I have 50% black people in the company or the cliched "I have a black friend, so I'm not racist."

It does not matter what the gender is. It does not matter what race you are from. It is not a pity game. Let them earn.
If anything, assist them. Help everyone get better regardless. Don't be positively biased towards one subset of the population that has been ill-treated previously in judgment scenarios where they don't have an impact.

Sure, in the name of freedom of choice, you can have Men's only, Women's only or Trans-only clubs, study groups, benefits or anything else but that doesn't make it any different from before. 

If you were discriminated against at one point of time, does it really change the situation, if you just happen to be discriminated for now ? The situation has remained just the same. There continues to be inequality of opportunity.

Cultural, Race, gender references make sense when the entire organization is around just that, bias.
If there are people that openly biased towards helping only certain communiities coming forward, that's a personal choice, but why not everyone else ?

The metric towards deciding if someone is worth something must be decisions and actions that are within a person's control.

In that sense, I think gender diversity is mostly hokum pokum. You don't need a gender to be critiqued for something that has nothing to do with gender.

Personal reference:
I noticed a bias with how I chose to follow people. 
Previously, I observed that I chose not to follow some people. 
Then, I asked the question, would I do the same if the person was of opposite sex ?
The answer was maybe/maybe not ?

Was the intiution I developed flawed ?
most probably.

We'll find out. I'm checking bios and recent tweets only now, before I look at their name or picture.

Don't succumb to devaluing standards for pretty petty statistics.

Having a 50:50 ratio of men and women implies that you cared more about maintaining the ratio in comparison to making the choice whether to hire or fire someone.
