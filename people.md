I've always wanted to meet the people in the following list for different reasons respectively.

Some, I find inspiring, motivating or I'm just genuinely curious about who they are as a person, what drives them and the ethos with which they lead their lives. Also, I beleive that there's a ton that I can learn from them or I think I can gain from an interaction with them.
I do understand that an hour of their time is valued differently than I choose to value an hour of my time. This is a list of people I'd love to meet one day. In which case, if you happen to be a part of this list and want to meet me in person, do let me know, I'd be more than happy to facillitate that. Cheers!
