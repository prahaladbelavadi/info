# If I forget everything tomorrow

## Morals:
- Provide value to others and capture value
- Learn skills to increase the value of your time.
- Invest proceeds when and where possible. Invest in people always.
- Spend time with people that are directly invested in your well being and progress. They are true family.
- Ensure that others profit off your success. Offer dividends off your existence. 
- Do not spend time with people that don't respect their own work or time. Its highly unlikely they'll respect yours either.
- Take time off, Don't burn yourself. 
- You are your first priority.
- Commit to something only after sufficient analysis is done. Less time is spent on analysis than upholding commitments. 
- If someone pushes you to anything, its a trap unless your success is benefitting them.
- Prioritize time, health and value produced to society.
- Nobody will respect you unless you are solving a problem or providing value.
- A single big picture outcome matters more than a million smaller outcomes.
- Work everyday to build a better future.
- There isn't reward without work. 
- Expecting rewards without proof of work is foolhardy. Don't do it.
- Everyone plays games. Government plays games too. Games can be brutally dishonest.
- Spend more time with people that are honest directly to your face. They'll help you survive.
- Commitment always beats luck. There isn't any substitute for hard work.
- Read and enrich yourself. Learn from other's mistakes. 
- You're much too valuable to commit mistakes and repent.
- Repenting and regret takes away valuable time. 
- Spend less time brooding. If you don't learn from mistakes, it'll happen again and drain you.
- Eat healthy vegetarian food. Your body doesn't process meat or eggs well. No egg, No fish, No meat.
- Spend time mingling with people that are average to safeguard oneself.
- Too much knowledge is a threat. Provide value while securing your own position.
- Work for everything you desire. There is no reward without work. Work smartly.
- Prioritise needs over wants.
- Lead a minimalistic life. 
- The world doesn't owe us anything, we owe a better future to our upcoming generations.
- Stay physically and mentally sound. You're more efficient when fit.
- Build something that can scale. Anything that cannot scale has limited scope.

# Personal:
- Use a notebook to make a list of stuff at morning that need to be accomplished by the day's end(helps you stay focussed and on track for the rest of the day without getting distracted.)
- There are much more developer tools and better documentation written for macs than there are for windows.(Legacy versions, path management and lagging isn't worth enduring.)


## Ideals
- You are the average of the five people you surround yourself with.

## Tips

- Buy a Mac not windows
