# If I forget everything tomorrow

## Morals:
- Provide value to others and capture value
- Learn skills to increase the value of your time.
- Invest proceeds when and where possible. Invest in people always.
- Spend time with people that are directly invested in your well being and progress. They are true family.
- Ensure that others profit off your success. Offer dividends off your existence. 
- Do not spend time with people that don't respect their own work or time. Its highly unlikely they'll respect yours either.
- Take time off, Don't burn yourself. 
- You are your first priority.
- Commit to something only after sufficient analysis is done. Less time is spent on analysis than upholding commitments. 
- If someone pushes you to anything, its a trap unless your success is benefitting them.
- Prioritize time, health and value produced to society.
- Nobody will respect you unless you are solving a problem or providing value.
- A single big picture outcome matters more than a million smaller outcomes.
- Work everyday to build a better future.
- There isn't reward without work. 
- Expecting rewards without proof of work is foolhardy. Don't do it.
- Everyone plays games. Government plays games too. Games can be brutally dishonest.
- Spend more time with people that are honest directly to your face. They'll help you survive.
- Commitment always beats luck. There isn't any substitute for hard work.
- Read and enrich yourself. Learn from other's mistakes. 
- You're much too valuable to commit mistakes and repent.
- Repenting and regret takes away valuable time. 
- Spend less time brooding. If you don't learn from mistakes, it'll happen again and drain you.
- Eat healthy vegetarian food. Your body doesn't process meat or eggs well. No egg, No fish, No meat.
- Spend time mingling with people that are average to safeguard oneself.
- Too much knowledge is a threat. Provide value while securing your own position.
- Work for everything you desire. There is no reward without work. Work smartly.
- Prioritise needs over wants.
- Lead a minimalistic life. 
- The world doesn't owe us anything, we owe a better future to our upcoming generations.
- Stay physically and mentally sound. You're more efficient when fit.
- Build something that can scale. Anything that cannot scale has limited scope.

# Personal:
- Use a notebook to make a list of stuff at morning that need to be accomplished by the day's end(helps you stay focussed and on track for the rest of the day without getting distracted.)
- There are much more developer tools and better documentation written for macs than there are for windows.(Legacy versions, path management and lagging isn't worth enduring.)

## Ideals
- You are the average of the five people you surround yourself with.

## Tips

- Buy a Mac not windows

    ___Half writtten article: re thinking where I'm going with life 05-08-2018 2:51 AM__
    
    
    What do I want to change this year ? How does this become a process ? and What do I want to retain in life
This




Things to change:
Drink more water
By physically active [Cultivate testosterone levels]
Train for grueling scenarios with variation and time to recover
Build a learning process; 

40 to 50 % of the day: learning
10–15% of the day: seek validation from society for what you've learned
Allocate periodic time for judgement, reallocation of time and analysis
Observe always; Metrify and emotional cost value analysis
10% : being grounded; 
Interact with normal people, cook, laundry, clean; Discipline
15: Producing value that will help sustain learning period phase
Dream of places you want to be at, situations that you'd like to be a part of, what you want and don't want. Build clear cut pathways for all.
passion doesn't exist. There isn't a long term happiness prospect unless its in hindsight. Take joy in little things for that's that exists in the future. Take exponential forward steps. Never skimp or adjust at goal setting. 
Metrifiable goals are dangerous. Given sufficient time and process, they will be achieved. Find processed that will keep you grooved while you reascertain goals. Finances must be on automatic framework. Impulse actions must be allocated for. Profit or loss as a result of impulse should be a cost you can bear without thinking too much. There must be a reward mechanism for learning. Acquisition of a some knowledge entitles you to a self reward; The reward isn't delivered upon and is held at bay until a validation milestone is achieved.
This will enforce responsibility. Minor rewards on completion prior to validation are acceptable. set time aside to research or chance to play its role.
Challenge your ways of thinking. Process always greater momentum than a singular goal; A series of compounding goals more so.
Schedule: 
I'd like to keep a set of actions that I do on a routine basis. Things that make me predictable and a schedule that makes me unpredictable, to basically do things I've always wanted to do.
There are things that make me human. I'd like to keep in touch with em.

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,
It feels good to be grounded.
Goal setting:
Ideally, I should set goals. Everything I want to do or want in materialistic possession is achievable. I'd need to dedicate appropriate amount of time and resources to do so. Today, I want to improve the world, but given my resources, I could spend my whole life doing something menial that could probably be contentful at the moment but gets stale over time without leaving options for future possibilities. In an Ideal scenario, I should step up from game to game looking for ways to ways play and win consistently in each game so as to elevate to the next successive one. Amongst the games there exist, there are games that only you play and there are games that the whole world plays. Taking joy in little things such as observation of raw human emotion is a joy you I undertake in person, but isn't relatable to the masses or rather they play the game of value exchange and compounding with social strata, respect, allure and carnal (sex) instinctive games.
I Want to set goals and allocate time lines. I want to reanalyse in those timelines to gauge if I'm going where I want to.


Financial games: 

If you can dream and not make dreams your master,
The social stroking structure is essential. I find it necessary to stay sane. Sometime, they are a drag but a necessity. Each person might not necessarily be individualistically unique or a value addition but it is essential to understand (relate or be perceptive) in order to co exist.
Instantiate a financial framework which will ensure that you shall compound upon whatever earnings required for prolonged existence. 
Expense = Income: [Fixed sustenance + compounded investing + minor reward system]
There are times when the journey is internal and is dependant on working on yourself which requires that it be done in solace alone. There are times when journey with other people of similar or diverse skill and trade will enhance your life with perceptions that cannot be acquired alone. The society acknowledges power in masses. Sometimes the system doesn't make sense. It can be a shitty system; when faced with a lack of options, change can only be instilled by being a part of the system or if not by building a new system and gaining validation from masses.
Validation:

There is a significant amount of validation that influences a person. It could be a time, place, occurence, people or anything rather. Validation is a form of stroking. Validation stroking is self induced; Implying that people are seeking validation to goals, agendas that they themselves accept or project. Validation stroking is essential since it is inheerent to the person themselves. The individualistic goals are set independently. They don't have to be outsourced and often with the right set of events conditioning the human brain to warp arround incidents. this makes a compelling case for passion, revenge, and action elliciting emotions.
Conditoining: 

People are conditioned. Growth as a person or maturity rather is a result of conditioning. Maturing is a process by which people are able to make decisions with a different frame of reference that the elder population can relate to. Validated people 's opinions are given a higher preference for being accepted as a result of biased perceptions.
Conditioning doesn't have to be a result of other people influencing your line of thought. Circumstantial or situational awareness is a result of conditioning. People dread to be in a situation that they were uncomfortable in. They try in their best interests to avoid arriving at similar situations again. This drives people to put in hours of labour; aversive to poverty. 
Conditioning also involves habits, fears, biases and perceptions that form a basis as to how people judge. 
Human ability to judge is essential. Modern media with its extensive pre validated history and scalable approach is at a critical position to have the ability to reach out to people. They bear the power to command validation at scale. People are conditioned to rely on them. This foothold only increases with positive reliability over time. 
Authority:

Power is a double edged sword. Systems are designed in a manner to allocate responsibility prior to reward or entitlement which equates to validation. Anythign worth working for would require that you demonstract responsibility of being ethical and willingness to play by the systems rules prior to it rewarding you or validating your essence at scale. 
People, organizations or groups of people at authority bear in power an ability to be validated. Societal structures lean towards power and number of value producing masses. The choice of decision making at critical vantage points is a cumulative result of validation and ability to convince, overpower and or of of these society bound constructs
Shame;

Shame isn't a biological primitive concept but rather a societal impulsive complex. Primates are observed to have expressed shame. Shame and pride are two sides of the same coin. They are both societal complexities.
In prey or predator scenario, the concept of shame isn't result of evolutionary implication. It is expressed amidst masses or peers. It is a conditioned reflex in most cases. Human ability to express shame and pride is a result of having developed a perception from another's interpretation. Jealousy is a craving need for validation with a biased regard to subject in perception.
Scale:

Computer can scale. Humans cannot. Overpopulation is a result of trying to scale number of earning members. Mismanagement of assets is a grave concern. With low economic overhead costs, if one can provide similar or equivalent value, break even can be achieved. Anything above breakeven is considered reward by the system (validation follows). Scaling earning or potential value generating assets will place one at a considerably high place in the hierarchical validation structure.
Bias:

Bias is a catalyst in a mental model. Bias in mental models is essential and applies specifically. They cannot be ported over without due justification and if they are, it is not very helpful. If mental model is a ferris wheel, bias is the fulcrum that caused the wheel to rotate around an axis. Different rides have different fulcrum points for different outcomes. Having a single bias towards all mental models is a flawed structure of evaluating situations.
