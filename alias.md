I've been known by the follwing names:
- Paisa : From when I worked at the farmer's market. My coworkers could not pronouce my name. They thought I looked mexican and called me paisa; as in paisano. 
This wasn't in anyway derogatory but made me feel inclusive.
- PR: From working at Radioshack, I was called PR since it was easier to pronounce than my real name. This continued over to my workplace at Perry's.
