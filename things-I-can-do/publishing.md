I notice I have things thins where I can delve into a topic and dig.

Stuff like roman and treek history fascinates me.
Stories about people, Who they are, where they come from , what motivates thema re things I find very fascinating.

Its beautiful to know what drives these people to do their daily life stuff. 

I can ______ stuff in ____ format that contains condensed structural notes of anything and everything that I like.
Example: I can write stuff in a PDF format that elucidates how to go about applying for a license at an RTO.
While it could be as trivial as something that a lot of people have already written about and there exists documentation to do so, it also allows me to share my experience. This might be something that people pay for someday, a curated experience or piece of work by someone that they find is reliable? maybe


For example, I can make a bio about a person, their affiliations, what kind of coffee they like, what investors they're talking to, where they come from, what cultural policies are they likely to follow, what they do on their free time, what hobbies are they invested in and stuff like that.

As ambiguous as it sounds, it helps me understand people better. It helps me connect to them on a deeper level at something they like.

There are certainly numberous number of things that I've never tried and am unaware of the joy itcould give me but doing activities with someone that already knows their way around and enjoys is a great company to do those things with.
