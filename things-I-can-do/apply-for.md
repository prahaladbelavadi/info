I don't know what happens if I get Hired except I'd be working on what I'd like to be working on, making an impact on this world.
I don't control if I'll get hired or recruited or not. What I do control is that I can apply. These are a list of places I can apply to.


A list of places I can apply to:
- [x] Blockchain

- [x] Coinbase
