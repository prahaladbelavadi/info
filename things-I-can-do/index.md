Often I find myself saying things like, I could do this, I'd love to do this, THIS IS AWESOME!

Its not a question of choosing either this or that. Its just that somethings I might not be able to do right away. 

I'm certainly excited about it but it could be a situation where: 
  - I don't have enough cash, finances, experience or relevance or urgency right away.
  - Lower Priorities
  - Have to choose between things
  
  There's often times when I'm unable to do something because of what so ever reasons that might not necessarily remain the same throughout my life. Hence I want to make a list of things that I can do, individually as a person that would excite me, for say money, fun or some kind of weird adrenaline rush.
  After all, You live only once. For long, I've been living my life by the YOLO strategy and not having a list of things I want to do is just aa whole lot of ambiguity that I'd rather not put up with. Imagine knowing that you were excitied about something but can't remember what it was that you wetre excited about, that feels pretty shitty.
  Hence, I'd like to record a list of things that I'd want to do someday in my lifetime.
  
  If anyone going through this at one point wants to join, help or get involved in any way, feel free to get in touch with me. 
  More the merrier, albeit realize that I tend to optimiz for quality over quantity. The sweet spot is subjective. After all we live only once.
  
  There's initiatives too that I'd love to be a part of like non profits, startups, social change, open source dev, growth and progess as a nation or globally, I want to keep a record of that too.
  
  Given that time is so scarce, I might not be able to accomplish everything on this list, but at least it'll help me remember and make better decisions down the line on what I want to do/what experiences I want to fill my life with.
  
  Valar Moghulis implies that all men must die. This isn't really sexist, but very real. Everybody dies, not just men or whatever sex or creed or class or whatever bucket you fall into.
  Ideology is to make this life worthwhile, make it exciting to a point where you don't regret it down the line. Optimizing for a life with lower regrets.
  
  This was supposed to be a tiny description, but what the hell  
  

      ¯\_(ツ)_/¯



  Go big or go home!
  Cheers!
