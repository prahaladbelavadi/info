- Prospect1:
  - Understand what the value proposition is
  - Update a repo on interesting thoughts, links I come across; that 's public 
  - charge a minimal fee for subscribing to the newsletter for the added convenience oof receiving it directly in your inbox
  - allow people to pledge for the objective
    - Eg: I want to crowdfund for the server costs. people decide if they want to back and pledge their money. More people being involved implies that there is a lesser cost per person. If there happens to be additional surplus as in a situation where I'm crowdfunding for $5- eq of  355  rupees and there  happens to be a group of people larger that 355 people each pledging 1 rupee, which is the lowest paymment processors will take, it 'll carry on over to the next month or te scale  at which they are funding cchanges. Instead of monthly, it  can become part of approximated yealy contribution.
   - Allow people  to fund certain stages of projects being built.
   - Allow people to buy certain portions of my hourly time.
   - Allow people to compete for utilities(yet to decide)
