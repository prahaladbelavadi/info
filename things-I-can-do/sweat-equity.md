# A venture fund: Sweat Equity

The firm is positioned pre angel and at pre seed level.

The firm shall undertake more of value addition compared to monetary funding in startups.

The firm shall also inadvertently be the first point of contact for startup founders that want to start a company but don't know where and how to start.

The firm shall, at most in financial terms cover the first year of online presence and necessary workload prior to proving business model.

The operating strategy will be based on to fund or propel as many as ideas into businesses and businesses to startups that can do a proof of concept prior to gaining their first customer.

The concept of sweat equity will be to value the value proposition in terms of the company to be made.

The amount of time and effort added to the company will be valued in terms of equity of what the company could later go on to be.

Often the valuation of the company that sweat equity shall get involved in is anywhere between 10K usd to 100K USD.

Lower valuation companies must display incorporation of company, demonstrate seriousness in starting a value proposition to someone.
Higher valuation companies are to be engaged only where there is a proven business model and there is conviction that the team shall execute and market is likely to favour the existence and persistence of the company for long term.

The optimization factor of sweat equity as a VC firm isn't to just make revenue, it is to ensure sustainability of a company.

Revenue or not, if the company can exist for a significantly long period of time while increasing marginally, providing value to customers, that is the sign of a cultural shift that sweat Equty firm shall invest in.

Also, depending on valuation, the amount of equity can be liquidated, sold back to the company when ever mutually decided by both the owner of the company and the firm. The amount of equity asked from a company in exchange for services offered can range anywhere between 1% to 15% depending on the valuation.

Often, if ideas are worth nothing, what adds value is the abiluy to go find a paying customer and scale that process to be net profitable sustainably.

The firm shall be act in the grey area between idea and an MVP.

Also the firm operates on a spray and pray methedology where not all startups are expected to be unicorns or even famous,they are expected to fail and hopefully some end up becoming sustainable businesses for a considerably long span of time.
