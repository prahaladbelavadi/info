At times, you find yourself sitting still.
What you do not see is the motion happening around.

There's always moving elements.
You were the resultant of a biliion/million years of evolution. 

Sitting still today is miniscule compared to that.

Snowball effect is the effect of compounding. There appears a point of time after doing one or a set of actions in a particular direction, it hits a tipping point. The tipping point is a point after which the metric graph skews. In an anti fragile sense, on hitting the tipping point, the particular action that it took to achieve the same metric just became a whole lot easier.

The snowball effect implies that upon hitting tipping point after a significant push, there is no turning back, the point of no return. The effects, effort and everything else within in that scope shall compound. The direction initial trajectory becomes very important since it decides if things are looking up or looking south. 

I find it a little funny how having one drink does not make someone develop attachments or let alone any kind of hard sentiment towards it, but to someone that that is a recovering alchoholic, it sets the ball rolling. The tipping point could be 2 drinks or 10 but the motion has started. 

It often does not matter where the timeline starts. It matters what is done during the course of the timeline since most of the actionable items within the timeline are within our control sans what we cannot control. Those that we cannot control is in a state of flux too that we probably don't understand just as well yet. 

Here me, If at all you start today and the next 1000 days, you lift. You shall be bulky nevertheless. The tipping point is somewhere in between the begininning and the ending. The snowball effect continues until theres a change, in direction, trajectory or surface(environment). It isn't a moment that can be stopped, but it can certainly erode under the right conditions.

Make positive effects snowball. Workouts and healthy eating that may snowball will lead to a longer lifespan where as smoking and drinking lead to a shorter lifespan.

In startups, the snowball effect in onboarding users occurs as the people converse about it in their daily life.
The tipping point towards the snowball effect is when the user begins to develop strong emotions towards the company.
 
Leverage it. Compounding works until a certain point. It is a type of progression eventually.
