- Web page to PDF Use cases:

  - Gatewalled Pay per view:
  
    There exists a market in subscription for journalistic websites. Pay per view has normally been used around academic circles.
    [People](https://twitter.com/paulbz/status/1278297515520077825?s=20) complain about the lack of singular access point for viewing content from multiple places . 
    If we could aggregate all the subscriptions into one and roll it out, it'd save time and effort for the end user.
    Most articles require people to be online. Scraping the webpage into a pdf would allow people to save articles that they'd want to otherwise read later, say on a flight or somewhere there's no access to internet. This functionality could be used as devdocs for journalistic articles or other longform type articles.
    
  - Viewable dump of content heavy sites:
  
    There exist sites like farnam street blogs, Makebook, hackingwithswift.com which hold quality content for free online. The ability to extract data and compile them into a readable format would make it easier for bloggers to make books directly from their websites without having to rewrite or retrace the whole process.
  
  - Governmental organizations are currently clogged up with pictures of documents. Giving them the ability to port data into PDF format as and when necessary will prompt them to go web first which increases accessibility for a lot of people. Making information accessible over the web in granular forms also means that there's greater scope for validation and automated verification both from governance and tech point of view.
  
  - Unexplored DRM: 
    
    Web based access is controlled using JWT tokens and sessions. Converting webpages to PDF will allow industries to provide offline call to actions with necessary authentication which reduces friction in onboarding from an offline to an online medium. Packaging web based content as PDF will allow for greater versatility with respect to the set of devices it can support. Kindle, while it has browser support is a pain to use internet with, it would make much more sense to download a pdf version of whatever I'm trying to read and load it on instead of using it for internet.
    

  - Prisons and schools: 
  
    Prisoners and schools have limited access to the internet. They can provide what would otherwise be online content with minimum overhead to the students and prisoners for upskilling.
