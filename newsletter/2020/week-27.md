- Web page to PDF Use cases:

  - Gatewalled Pay per view:
  
    There exists a market in subscription for journalistic websites. Pay per view has normally been used around academic circles.
    People complain about the lack of singular access point for viewing content from multiple places.
    If we could aggregate all the subscriptions into one and roll it out, it'd save time and effort for the end user.
    Most articles require people to be online. Scraping the webpage into a pdf would allow people to save articles that they'd want to otherwise read later, say on a flight or somewhere there's no access to internet. This functionality could be used as devdocs for journalistic articles or other longform type articles.
    
  - Viewable dump of content heavy sites:
  
    There exist sites like farnam street blogs, Makebook, hackingwithswift.com which hold quality content for free online. The ability to extract data and compile them into a readable format would make it easier for bloggers to make books directly from their websites without having to rewrite or retrace the whole process.
