# Twitter game


## Current behavior:

I've been passively active on twitter. There's a ton of smart people on twitter and its a pretty cool place to hang out. There's a ton of insights that come from being around the right circles and those right circles tend to hangout around twitter within the VC and startup world.

I tend to shy away from interacting with online personas with a couple of thoughts on my mind:
- What if I'm wrong ?
- What if I rub someone the wrong way ?
- There's probably someone else that's smarter than me addressing it, if its important.
- How can I not involve myself in what could become a socialmedia disaster or something that might end up haunting me or people I care about in the future ?
- What if some of my biases and convictions are wrong ? I don't want to be subjected to Mob justice online.
- What if the way I talk and convey or by way of interaction in all innocence, I'm hurting someone online.
- Is this really what I want the world to know about how I think ?
- I can be held responsible for my words.
- People that follow me, I have to churn out valuable content for them, else they'll unfollow me.
- Maintain a high signal to noise ratio in my tweets

On chancing upon some articles who have leveraged twitter to make progress in life, I feel like I'm not using twitter to its complete extent.

I want to be a lot more active on twitter and it becomes hard unless I have a framework in mind as to how I shall approach the set of situations.


My line of thought is such that:
- I shall engage in discourse that's worthwhile to me and the person I'm interacting with.
- I shall be explicit in proposing or engaging in any conversation that wasn't directed at me.
- Make no presumptions based on age or gender. If I unknowingly do, acknowledge when I find out, apologize and try not to repeat making such presumptions going forward. The presumption that someone who is or claims to be skilled in their field would have relevant context within their respective fields, stays. They might not know where I come from or my background (they might not need to), if I'm engaging in conversation within their discipline, I presume they know their field. 
- Acknowledge if I've made a mistake publicly.
- Respect gender pronouns and cultures. It doesn't make a difference as to how people refer to me. I'll respect their preferences if they have any.

On signalling:
I wouldn't like or comment on things that'd make me feel like I could be wrong or what I'd think was worthwhile to my audience. Lest, should I be sending out the wrong type of signals. But does it really matter ?
All this curation of signals and I'm still stuck at 300 ish followers. I don't get why I'm optimizing for followers but curation of signals clearly hasn't worked out. I'd rather immerse myself in what the platform has to offer and see what comes out of it.

Screw signalling. I think if I could be myself on the internet, and people come to interact, they'd be doing so, for who I am and I wouldn't have to think twice about how I'm signalling. Worrying about my followers timeline is the digital version of 'What will others say' or 'log kya kahenge'. Let's go all out.

In this one tiny life I have, do the number of likes, replies or tweets that I have of twitter really matter so much ? Probably not. Tech is mostly a means to an end and not the end itself. In that sense, tech is te means to meet more people and nothing more; signalling is hampering the process by adding undue pressure on who I should portray myself to be and what standards I uphold myself to.
